   (Edit > Generate Fake Protocol)

   Generates a file in your project with a test double that implements the Swift protocol under your cursor. Inspired by [counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter).

   ![Boom](/generate-fake.gif?raw=true)

   Given a swift protocol...

   ```swift
   protocol MySomewhatSpecialProtocol {
    func doesStuff(stuff: String, otherStuff: [String]) -> ([String], Int)
}
   ```

   After you generate a fake and add the new file to your project, you can use the generated fake in tests like so...

   ```swift
   describe("a generated fake for a contrived protocol") {
      var subject : FakeMySomewhatSpecialProtocol!

      beforeEach() {
          subject = FakeMySomewhatSpecialProtocol.init()
      }

      it("conforms to the MySomewhatSpecialProtocol protocol") {
          var test : MySomewhatSpecialProtocol
          test = subject
          expect(test).toNot(beNil())
      }

      it("allows you to stub the return value for methods that return values") {
         subject.doesStuffReturns((["test-yo"], 5))

         let tuple = subject.doesStuff("this", otherStuff: ["that"])
         expect(tuple.0).to(equal(["test-yo"]))
         expect(tuple.1).to(equal(5))
      }

      it("allows you to write assertions for the arguments passed into each invocation") {
         subject.doesStuffReturns(([], 0))
         subject.doesStuff("kool", otherStuff: ["keith"])

         var args = subject.doesStuffArgsForCall(0)
         expect(args.0).to(equal("kool"))
         expect(args.1).to(equal(["keith"]))

         subject.doesStuff("dr", otherStuff: ["octogon"])

         args = subject.doesStuffArgsForCall(1)
         expect(args.0).to(equal("dr"))
         expect(args.1).to(equal(["octogon"]))
      }
   }
   ```

# change-method-signature
   <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd>

   Refactor the method under the cursor. Add, remove and re-order selector components, change types and names.

   (Edit > Refactor Current Method)

# Known defects

* Generate Fake   : Does not support initializers
* Generate Fake   : Does not support protocols that include other protocols
* Generate Fake   : Does not handle protocols that use `typealias`
* Refactor Method : Only supports instance methods
* Refactor Method : ay get confused when an argument is a protocol type (e.g.: `id<AnyProtocol>`)
* Refactor Method : Cannot find call sites of methods in all `.mm` files. (especially Cedar specs)
* Refactor Method : Will rewrite **any** call site for selectors that match (e.g.: it will match any `-init` when rewriting call sites).
* Refactor Method : Will not rewrite any matching @selector()

# Uninstalling the plugin
Plugin can be uninstalled by removing `XcodeBetterRefactorTools.xcplugin` from `~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`

or

`rake uninstall`

# Would not have been possible without the hard work of
* Brian Croom -- fixed obnoxious `fake4swift` CLI warnings
* Helen Tang -- created the 'fake mustache' icon (disguise by Helen Tseng from the Noun Project)
* Ludmil -- created the 'swift' icon (swallow by ludmil from the Noun Project)
