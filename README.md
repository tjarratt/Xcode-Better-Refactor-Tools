# Features

   <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>F6</kbd>
   
   Refactor the method under the cursor. Add, remove and re-order selector components, change types and names.
   
   (Edit > Refactor Current Method)

# Known defects

* Only supports instance methods
* May get confused when an argument is a protocol type (e.g.: `id<AnyProtocol>`)
* Cannot find call sites of methods in all `.mm` files. (especially Cedar specs)
* Will rewrite **any** call site for selectors that match (e.g.: it will match any `-init` when rewriting call sites).
* Will not rewrite any matching @selector()
